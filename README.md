Within the banking industry, optimizing telemarketing strategy is a key issue. The problem addressed in our project is the prediction of the success of telemarketing calls for selling long-term deposits by a Portuguese retail bank. We aim to develop machine learning models to assist bank marketing campaign managers in selecting the most promising customers to contact during their campaigns. By analyzing a dataset spanning from 2008 to 2010, we will focus on feature engineering and the comparison of three machine learning models (one stacking system + two strong learners) to determine the most effective approach for predicting campaign success. The goal is to reduce campaign costs, improve customer targeting, and enhance overall marketing campaign efficiency.
